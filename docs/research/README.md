## How These Reports Relate

Reports 01-02 analyze the **current state** (what exists today in the project structure and template).

Reports 03-04 research **industry standards and best practices** for project organization, document management, and AI-assisted workflows.

Reports 05-08 investigate **specific integration capabilities** that could enhance the workflow: Google Workspace connectivity, mobile messaging bots, the MCP server ecosystem, and field data synchronization.

Together, these reports provide the foundation for designing an improved project template and tooling system for Precept Systems.
